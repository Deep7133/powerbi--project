# 📘 Asthma Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project
A complete end-to-end data analysis project focusing on asthma prevalence, risk factors & clinical indicators using a synthetic dataset of 10,000 patients.

# 🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes a synthetic asthma dataset to understand:

How asthma is distributed across age, gender, smoking status, and pollution exposure

Which allergens contribute to asthma cases

How asthma control level impacts ER visits and lung function

How BMI and medication adherence influence asthma outcomes

I built two interactive Power BI dashboards:

Page 1 — Asthma Overview Dashboard

Page 2 — Risk Factors & Clinical Indicators Dashboard

These dashboards help visualize patient behavior, identify high-risk groups, and understand asthma severity patterns.

## 📊 PAGE 1 — Asthma Overview Dashboard (Summary & Insights)

✔ Cards I Built

Total Patients (10,000)

Asthma Patients Count (2433)

Average FeNO Level (25.10)

Average ER Visits (1.02)

✔ Charts

Allergies vs Count of Patients

Age Group vs Count of Patients

Smoking Status vs Count of Patients

Gender (Asthma) Donut Chart

Air Pollution Level vs Count of Patients

## 🎯 PAGE 1 — What This Dashboard Helps With

Identify high-risk age groups

Understand environmental impact (pollution, allergens)

Recognize behavior triggers (smoking)

Compare asthma prevalence across segments

Understand population distribution


## 📊 PAGE 2 — Risk Factors & Clinical Indicators Dashboard
✔ Cards I Built

Average PEF = 400.88

Average Medication Adherence = 0.50

Average BMI = 25.05

Poor Control % = 46%

✔ Charts

Medication Adherence Distribution

BMI Category Donut Chart

Asthma Control Level Distribution

Average ER Visits by Control Level

Average PEF by Control Level

## 🎯 PAGE 2 — What This Dashboard Helps With

Identify patients who need urgent lifestyle or medication intervention

Link asthma severity with ER visits

Understand the relationship between BMI and asthma

Track clinical indicators like PEF & medication adherence

Evaluate overall asthma management quality


## 🎉 Final Summary

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, visualize, and interpret health-related data using Power BI.
The dashboards provide strong analytical insights into asthma prevalence, risk factors, and clinical indicators.
This is a complete data analytics project that showcases my skills in:
